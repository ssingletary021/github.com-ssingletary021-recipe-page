## My process
I started with HTML then CSS and I didn't remember about it needing to be responsive until I had the desktop version looking as close as I could get it. I struggled with trying to make it responsive afterwards.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I think overall, I've been afraid to move away from tutorials and just start coding because I know I have such a knowledge deficit, but I do feel more capable even though my solution is not perfect or completely correct. Regardless what anyone says, I feel like I did pretty well for my first time trying to code something on my own and I'm proud of myself.

I also learned to take a mobile first approach because it seems easier.

### Continued development

I'm not comfortable with any of this yet so I will continue to do challenges.
